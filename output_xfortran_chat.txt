**task: Write a Fortran program to compute Euler's number in a variable called `euler` using a Taylor series with the number of terms
`nterms` equal to 1000. Set `integer, parameter :: dp = kind(1.0d0)` and declare real variables
as `real(kind=dp)`. Use :: in declarations.  Use implicit none on the 2nd line
and make sure to declare all variables. Name the program 'main`. You MUST use
```fortran to show the start of Fortran code. Use loop variables named i, j, k, and
remember to declare them if used.**

attempt 1
!! Here is the Fortran program that computes Euler's number using a Taylor series:
!! 
program main
  implicit none
  integer, parameter :: dp = kind(1.0d0)
  real(kind=dp) :: euler, term, factorial
  integer :: nterms, i
  ! Set the number of terms in the Taylor series
  nterms = 1000
  ! Initialize the variables
  euler = 1.0_dp
  term = 1.0_dp
  factorial = 1.0_dp
  ! Compute Euler's number using the Taylor series
  do i = 1, nterms
    ! Compute the terms in the Taylor series
    term = term / i
    ! Compute the factorial
    factorial = factorial * i
    ! Update the Euler's number
    euler = euler + term
  end do
  ! Print the result
  print *, "Euler's number:", euler
end program main
!! 
!! Make sure to save the program with a `.f90` or `.f95` extension, and then compile and run it using a Fortran compiler.

attempt 2
!! Here is the Fortran program to compute Euler's number using a Taylor series:
!! 
program main
    implicit none
    integer, parameter :: dp = kind(1.0d0)
    real(kind=dp) euler
    real(kind=dp) term, factorial
    integer :: i, nterms
    nterms = 1000
    euler = 1.0_dp
    do i = 1, nterms
        term = 1.0_dp
        factorial = 1.0_dp
        do j = 1, i
            factorial = factorial * j
            term = term / j
        end do
        euler = euler + term
        if (term < 1.0e-15_dp) exit
    end do
    write(*,*) "The value of Euler's number is:", euler
end program main
!! 
!! In this program, we use a do loop to calculate each term in the Taylor series and add it to the `euler` variable. We also use a nested do loop to calculate the factorial and the term value. The loop variable `i` is used to keep track of the number of terms. The loop is terminated when the term value becomes very small (`< 1.0e-15`). Finally, we print the calculated value of Euler's number.
